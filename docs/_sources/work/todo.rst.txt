To Do
------

To add to meta view:
- current bar and step of selected track
- buttons for clear cur seq
- show mode
- cur selected dur



- add current ptrk to meta view
- make a snapshot save and restore - saves state of all sequencers
- put a reset button on the meta-view ui
- figure out how we will do the drums for mixes

- arp view changing bars? did this get done??
- saving a seq's settings that have been edited from the controllers
- hooking up controllers for each line


- fix being able to set many things from one line (ie seq-1 'set ....)
- this doesn't work: (seq-5 'update-chord-seq  0 '(60) 16 ('60))

- figure out how to fix the sync issue of scenes and chord updates
  - the chord update doesn't take place fast enough
  - scenes need to fire early somehow?

Arp seq/controller
- how to set master loop len for a seq?
- how to set chord loop len for a seq?
- start and stop sequences with quantization
- how to switch the keystep from arp controller mode
  to mute mode??  perform button? - use other keystep?
- shuffle? 

- drum programming device?
- allow shuffle setting

- would be good to have way to make a snapshot of *everything* wherever we are
  in order to insert this at some point while working on the arrangement
