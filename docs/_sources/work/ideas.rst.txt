New Ideas to explore
--------------------

- negative factors on the arps??
- allow each ptrk to have its own master loop 
- allow ptrks to freewheel as well as do modulo math for indexes

s4m ideas
---------
- have a hashtable for variables we want to persist after a reset
- should really be able to send a max message list message from a vector

Modular/synth ideas
-------------------
- as gate 5 goes out for track 5, I should be able to clock off that to the GM somehow, explore

Production Notes
----------------
- running bass line through delay that is band pass filtered worked very well with the GM

Sequencer
----------
Try making version of arp seq where the step time (per step) can be sequenced too
- this would allow some interesting looping things and exploring rhythmic patterns

- diatonic transposition
- variable step length sequencer patterns
