Csound Chord Instrument
-----------------------

Requirements
------------
- each osc needs to be its own thing so they can glide

- we need csound VCO output that accepts
- what would work nicely is that when a midi note comes in1, 

Done:
-----
- created csound instrument cs-chord-1.csd with fractional voice legatos
- 1.x is the oscillator bank, it's always on
- 2.x is the instrument that turns it on with the pitch signal

Input:
------
- midi input could work by waiting to send a message until there are 4 overlapping
  notes and then sending a message with 4 (or whatever) voices
- so a csound message would be 
- could use standard csound messages and have the orchestrator send them
  - would need to use the fractional on parts?

Input from S4M:
---------------
- s4m out 3 goes to cs-outs patcher, where we route from initial int
  - this is routed to sends: cs-1, cs-2, etc
- the csound receiver device has a track number, and will receive on that channel
- to send csound messages, we do
  (out 3 (list {cs-num} .... ))
- need to remember how to do the pitch legato too


To Do:
