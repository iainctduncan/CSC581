Output
-------
All output from sequencer now goes through (note-output), in output.scm
- this is where routing to the appropriate output handler (midi/cv/csound) is
- this function can be redefined in NAME-tools.scm for per tune routing
- it currently sends to both midi and cv-output

MIDI Output
-----------
- midi out goes out outlet 0 to the ptrack-outs patcher
- messages are: (chan, pitch, vel, dur)
- the midi-track-outs patcher uses makenotes and sends to trk-X-in-m
- CCs not yet implemented
- this then uses sends to send to the s4m-trk-in devices on each track
- NOTE: this introduces bad jitter, but is ok for writing sketches

CV Output
---------
- code is in cv-output.scm, with test Max patch in cv-out.maxpat
- CV signals can go out from either direct cv outs with encoders or midi messages to Live CV Tools
- advantage of CV Tools is the calibration and built in glide
- however, to get no jitter, the CV Tools need to be on the same track as the sequencer
- this mostly matters for gates though, slight delay on CV should be ok? (it should just glide?)

TODO:

Live Track output
-----------------
- note that for live track to work with ES-5, we have teh Send to ES-5 device on the
  individual tracks. This needs to be off for inline gate output (so there aren't double)

TODO: 
- being able to deactivate a specific gate via a send *from* the track would be good
  - should be hooked up to the same button that enables s4m seq output

Working Notes
-------------
- the cv-outs subpatch is hooked up to sm4 outlet 2
- currently it just sends to the cv-out-X receives - NO GOOD
- these are received on the ES 8 1/2 and ES 8 3/4 channels where they
  get turned into signals in the cv-out-1&2 device
- problem is that this is after a between track s/r pair
- what should happen is that the signal part should be used in s4m so that
  we can use audio routing to get the post glide signal to another track

- the audio routing fix needs to happen in the cv-outs subpatch
  - deferring this for now though as the gates being direct is enough for good timing
    with the modular
