Drum Tracks

Design Notes
------------

- it probably makes sense (to start) to have them route to one channel that is drums?
  - can work on best situation for routing later
- we can have the option of the sequencer always being locked to one note

- we have a track 8 in already, which gets all messages that go out with channel 8
