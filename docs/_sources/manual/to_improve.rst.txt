notes on arch to improve from the doc process.

- How midi-input finds controllers. This is a lookup in the global space,
  it would be better to use a registry of some kind in meta

- what would happen with two users?

- how the midi mapping is handled and the whole handled by mode
  thing is kind of shitty

- controllers get sequencers incorrectly, that should 
  be through the meta thing, not the tunes track-sequencers
  - should be ready for multiple seqs in a track
