Need help with the following:

Complex number 
2 (Basic) COMPLEX NUMBER MULTIPLICATION Show using a figure, programming, and math what 
is the result multiplying the complex number (2 + j) with j. 
For programming, represent the complex number as an array, list, or tuple and directly
implement the complex number multiplication in terms of real and imaginary parts without 
using any built-in libraries or types for complex numbers.

5 (Expected) Amplitude and Phase Estimation in Mixture This is an extension of question 4.
Extend your code from question 4 so that the three sinusoidal components have random phases
in addition to random amplitudes. Listen to the generated sound and create 4 plots one for
each individual sinusoid and one for the resulting mixed sound. Each plot should correspond
to the time duration of one period of the lowest sinusoid (100hz)
). Show how the amplitudes and phases can be estimated for this sound in two ways:
a) by brute force checking even possible phase value and selecting that one that results
in the highest dot product with a basis sinusoid of the appropriate frequency b) by
taking the dot product of the mixture with a sine component and a cosine component.

8 (Expected) COMPLEX NUMBER PLOTTING Write code that takes as input a time in minutes and
seconds and converts that to two complex numbers corresponding to the positions of the 
minute hand and second hand on a clock. What complex number do we need to multiply a particular
second hand position to move by one second (clockwise)? What complex number of we need to 
multiply to move by one second (counter-clockwise). Show your answer by creating a corresponding
plot.

- go over material George has on Kadenze MIR course

- Project question, what would it take for that
