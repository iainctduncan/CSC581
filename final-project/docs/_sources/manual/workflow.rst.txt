Workflow in Live
================

* s4m-live-code.amdx is the root device loaded on track 0 for any piece

Files
-----
* in the 'tunes' folder there are folders for each piece
* there is a 'new' folder that acts as a template for making a piece
* new-main.scm is the top level scm file for the piece
* the 'Main' text box sets the file for Live set, which is saved with the set
* tunes/new/s4m-new.als is intended to stay as the template live file for a blank tune
* The Save Dir: sets the s4m save directory through the set-save-dir function, setting global \*save-dir\*
* this is also patched into the main file (new-main.scm) so that it's always right on a reset

Making a new tune
-----------------
* in the tunes directory: python3 new_tune.py {tune_name}
* open the Ableton file, and change the main .scm file in s4m and reset
* check audio port is set correctly
* open the files go into the new tune dir and do: mvim -S new-tune.vim
* update the tempo in the new tune

TODO:
-----
- figure out the tempo thing somehow??
