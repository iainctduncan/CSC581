Notes on the drum sequencer
===========================

Questions:
- is the drum machine one multi-track sequencer for all the drums, unlike regular seqs.
  - I think probably so, makes more sense for editing, copying, etc
  - there can always be more than one multi-drack drum machine going

- params:
  - gate
  - dur
  - vel
  - pitch??

- actually chord data make sense for drums too, allowing easy changing of sample sets
- in which case I think the only thing that becomes different is the output file
  so how can we make that a mix in type situation??

- so really there can be the same kind of sequencer and what we need is a drum-mode controller
