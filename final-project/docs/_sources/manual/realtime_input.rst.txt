Real-time Input
================

Overview
--------
This page describes how real-time input from the hardware controllers works 
from the user's perspective. (Internal details will be covered in the architecture documentation.)

The purpose of a controller is to provide a state container for modal editing,
where particular input motions cause a variety of state changes.
These usually fall into one of the following categories:

* Selections: track, bar, step, etc.
* Submode selection: arpeggiator on/off, chord mode on/off, etc.
* Data entry that is stored, but not yet acted upon ("cold")
* Data entry that results in messages to sequencers to update data ("hot")

The best way to describe the workflow is probably to describe my own 
personal configuration and the input modes I have created for it.
I will first describe my MIDI hardware controller configuration.


My hardware
------------
My hardware devices consist of:

* The Akai Fire, a 16x4 grid with miscellaneous extra buttons
* The grid, which is actually made up of two launchpads acting as one 16x8 grid
* Two keystep mini keyboards, which have keyboards, a mod and pitch bend ribbon, and various buttons. The larger of which also has 4 dials.

At a high level, when I'm editing I want to to use a global mechanism
to choose any selections that I want to persist **across modes**.
An example would be track selection - I don't want
to have re-select track 1 when moving between drum and step mode.
I also need a way to choose the active mode, which for simplicty I do from the same controller. 

In my mapping, the Fire acts as the this global controller. Input to it
changes global selections that are state in the meta component, 
thus all the Fire buttons always do the same thing, regardless of the active input mode. 
(I have also found this easier to remember!)

In my configuration, the fire grid rows are used to select

#. Track
#. Bank (unused at the moment)
#. Bar
#. Step

Additionally, the Fire has buttons along the bottom used to select the input mode.
Modes I have currently enabled include **drum**, **step**, **arp**, **perform**, and **copy**,
which each corresponding to one input controller Scheme object. 
When I change modes, the various buttons and keys on the other three devices (grid, keyb-1, keyb-2)
mean different things, and different actions are "hot", meaning they result in writes to sequence data.

One additional feature worth mentioning before getting into mode details is a trick
I came up with for entering numerical data from piano keyboards. 
As a jazz player, I have internalized the scale numbers to near-instant recall.
So to enter the values 0-15 from a piano keyboard, I use two octaves of the C7 bebop scale,
where the note values of C, D, E, F, G, A, Bb, B correspond to 0 to 7.
This allows me to enter a series of numbers far faster than on conventional buttons
and to memorize common rhythmic figures as chord shapes. 

I use two Arturia KeyStep mini piano keyboards for input, and these will be referred to
as **keyb-1** and **keyb-2**. These also include some knobs, and a pedal input.
I refer to the 16x8 grid (of the two launchpad mini's)
as thhe **pad-grid** or **pads**, and the Fire as the **global controller** or **fire**.


Input mode examples 
--------------------------

Once we have selected the active input mode from the global input controller, 
actions on the mode-specific input devices are, wherever possible,
idempotent. This on the principle that we should not ever *need* to look at a screen
for confirmation. If, once in a mode, a button does one thing, and always that thing, 
keeping track of where we are is straightforward (with some practice!).

So for example, if I am in **drum mode**, input works somewhat like a drum machine:
I make various selections that are stored in the controllers local memory, such
as what ptich or velocity I would like to use.
Then I hit a button or key that signifies a step, and this causes
all my parameter selections to be written in. 
In this case, we say that *step selection is hot* - 
it is the act of choosing a step that results
in all the (already) selected field data being written to sequencer data.

The drum mode order of operations is roughly:

* We make (or reuse) the current meta selections for track and bar
* We set some values with sliders (velocity, duration, mod-1, etc.)
* Perhaps we select a pitch with keyb-2
* We then hit keyb-1 ("hot") to enter these notes, resulting in messages going
  to the sequencer for the currently selected track, which result in sequence
  data getting updated.

On the otherhand, when we are in **step mode**, the process is reversed - we
pick a step (which doesn't by itself change anything),
and then any editing motions (notes, sliders, etc) are written in *as they are touched*.
We say that step selection is cold while faders are hot. 
We can keep moving faders, and they will keep writing to the same step
until we select a new step.

So the step mode order of operations is roughly:
  
* We make (or remember!) the current global selections for track and bar
* We pick a specific step from the Fire or keyb-2
* We then move sliders, touch the pads, or play notes on keyb-1 to enter data.

It is important to note that we do not (necessarily) need to reselect everything
to write it in. For example, in drum mode, if keyb-2 selects C5, the
selected pitch is C5, and that will be used for every step written until a new
pitch is selected. This can of course be configured, and in my personal 
(rather complex) input modes, I have included the ability to choose which 
parameter fields automatically persist or not across actions, with the
pitch bend and pedal used to create meta-keys to accomplish this.

In addition to the drum and step modes detailed above I have:

* Arp mode, a variant of step mode that allows chord and arpeggiator input
* Copy mode (in progress) for copying sequence data
* Perform mode (in progress), for mix and track muting and automation

While this may sound intimidatingly complex, with practice it enables
extremely fast data entry. I have found the key to designing modes that
are effective in practice is be consistent on what kinds of selections
are global versus local, and to keep (as much as possible) the input
hardware in alignment with this.
