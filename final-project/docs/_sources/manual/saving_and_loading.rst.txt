Saving and Loading Sequences
============================

Sequencers can be saved and loaded to plain scm data files using the functions in seq-load-save.scm
The files are string representations of lists that can be loaded into variables by using the normal
s7 (load {filename}) function. 

*save-dir* is a top level global with the fullpath to the save directory for a session. This is set
from the top level s4m patcher. 

BUG: it needs a trailing slash

(save-seq seq filename)
Saves a .scm file with a 3 element list of
  - hash-table of all serializable params, in the order of the meta-keywords attribute of the sequencer
  - vector of all the ptrack vectors
  - vector of the chord data

(load-seq-data filename)
This returns the loaded data from a file load, using *save-dir* and the filename. The data loaded
is a 3 element list, suitable for use by load-seq.

(load-seq seq file-or-data)
This loads a file, using the *save-dir* global plus the filename, setting data in the seq from the
saved list.

Usage Notes:
------------
- using load-seq with a filename will hit disk, which suprisingly seems to be fine!
- however to not hit disk, one can preload them to data vars, and then sequence
  setting from the data vars in the score:

  (define s1a-data (load-seq "s1a.scm")
  ... 
  (load-seq seq-1 s1a-data)
