Work Log
========

Next: 
- mod data out to modular and to GM
  - this means both modwheel and velocity I think
 - fix view to allow more notes in chords
  
Next Milestones:
- getting copy, perform, snapshots done for complete step seq environment
- hooking up param fields to modular
- documenting system to hand in for course
- new view that shows data for all 16 tracks at once (master loop, gates)
  - can swtich param on it

High Priorities for seq
- detaching chord time from main time factor (for counterpoint)
  - adding chord loop len and separate chord time factor
- view responding to bar selection (to see later bars)
- add broadcast module for updating meta view widgets
- enter chord factors in step mode with keyb bebop
- full save snapshot
- fix how controllers are instantiated (shouldn't be in tune)

Ondeck:
- hopefully start copy mode - can this be in perform mode??

2023-03-5
- perform mode works for loop lens and mutes
  - will need to do more once chord looping is improved in the chord seq

2023-03-4
- step mode is basically done, will get tweaked as I use it
  - could do with some more meta objects GUI elements
- left off testing and debugging the grid rows function in perform

2023-03-3
- working on adding second keyboard and step mode
- basics of step mode working

2023-02-23/24
- working on the seq setup code

2023-02-18
- brief work on feb-16 tune in morning to check it
  - have ideas on what to do with it
  - need to come up with way to program chord movements more easily (record them from Live, etc)

2023-02-17
- worked on feb-16 tune again, still like it

2023-02-16
- started new tune, feb-16. it's good, woot!

2022-11-23
- short session on oct-1 tune
- intro still bad, fixed that I think?
- started learning timeless 3, put it on s1
  - need to figure out how to automate from scheme

2022-11-19
- worked on oct-1, got arrangement done actually done (wasn't really done), length is 5 min
- has auto filter fades at end, which are working nicely
- todo: ptrk mod, delay mod

2022-11-14
- morning writing, worked for about 3 or 4 hours?
- got overall arrangement of Oct-1 finished
- next: add dubber automation, switch to modular, work on ptrk auto

2022-11-11
- short session, working on oct-1

2022-11-10
- doing short writing session in evening
- working on arrangement for oct-1
- going to try doing mutes with the live clips

2022-11-09
- at desk to write at 7:30
  - initiating plan to try writing every day, esp mornings
  - worked on writing for several hours in morning
- worked on oct-1. added new bell line, sorted out some arranging stuff
- ready to now have arrangement done I think
  - maybe one more line?

2022-11-08
- worked on the oct-1 piece
  - experimented with the Live dub keys device, it has a lot of potential
  
2022-10-25
- working on the writing setup
- figured out I need keys going to ext out (bpassing master busses) to not get tons of latency
- going to work on a new tune to practice doing all the things
- need to get the keyboards overriding chords in the arp seq
- urgent: need way to wipe chord bars!!

2022-10-24
- attempting to do short writing session with full setup
- issue, no csound6 for M1 yet! need to do that. oops
  - I guess I will use zebra for chords for now on it??

2022-10-22
- have been working on thesis lately, hence the gap
- resuming work on getting four voices from modular running
- figured out best way to tune is to send 1s out and just move the jacks to get them in tune
- still need to figure out how I want to output velocity and mod.
- hooked up grandmother, but how to send out extra values?

2022-10-07
- working on getting four synths going
- fixed the damn vcos, woot!

2022-10-05
- get four voices going of synth
- seems like gate and cv routing is still not right, working on that
  - fixed now I think?

2022-10-01
- Goal: on live + modular setup with no send/receive latency issues
- got gate outputs working, but they are doing this through the cv-note-out function,
  which is also doing a bunch of shit it doesn't need to do if we're using midi to CV
  - this can be figured out later though

2022-09-26 to 30
- got the 0.4 release done
- put up videos for the ableton version and ableton install
- made example devices for the package

2022-09-19
- DONE gc clock needs to have protection added for when used in the low thread environment
- arg, in cleaning up the git tree (removing the build path) I borked xcode and now it's not 
  able to load the compiled external
- Fixed: fucked up my dev environment, need to fix xcode so it loads s4m properly

2022-09-10
- got live api patcher building automatically
- determined having it owned by external does not make sense *unless* it's always invisible,
  because otherwise users can delete it and then we have bad references
- next s4m thing is the gc clock, then it should be release ready

2022-09-9
- working on code again

2022-09-8
- going to do timing comparison eliminating s/r pairs before the gates
- figured out it's the send/receive pairs introducing the jitter
- got gates going out the s4m track, and timing is rock solid, <1ms jitter
- need to put the CV outs on devices in the same track somehow
- this would require sending midi messages out by channel on to the same device
- which probably means that we need to route audio to 7/8 so that the s4m-device
  can be a midi device instead of an audio one.

2022-09-2
- worked on using modular
- definitely need the snapshot-all feature!!
- figuring out delay on new system
- did timing tests and figured out my send and receives are making bad jitter

2022-08-1
 - resuming work on sets
 - fixing up the track gain device, I think I left it with the params still screwed up
 - left off fixing up the track fade things

2022-06-25
 - working on the live API controlled filter fade plugin
 - made new gain/gate/lp/hp track device with envs that 
 - added functions (gain) (fc) (gate) for controlling them
 - left off, need to finalize their param nums so it's consistent across tracks
 - all tracks will gain and fc, not all need gate or hp

2022-06
 - working on how arrangements will work
 - got scene functions working off midi clips
 - next: add the gate triggering to the audio tracks with the live API

2022-05-27
  - view-1 automatically follows track selection now

2022-05-25
  - worked on full workflow on new tune 'kestrel'
  - intention to program it all in with controllers
  - got chords to zebra going, and track selecting working properly
  - next: need view to also follow track select
  - recorded a chord prog to use for it too
  - fixed data path to persist on reset
    - still gets lost on device edit though
  - cleaned up new tune template & script

2022-05-22
  - added tiny grid to view-1, cs-view-1-main-loops, to hold main and chord loop
  - can I change bars yet for where I'm looking??
  - fixed up and documented loading and saving sequences to data files, working!

  - continuing to work on remotes
  - test with fade in of delays on some instruments
  - make midi sends to those??
  - got final system in place for remotes
  - NEXT: copy out what I did for track 1 p1 to the others
    - this allows the control update to stay current from ramps, and saves with the set properly

2022-05-07
  - working on live api and remoting for the track delays

2022-05-06
  - got velocity working on csound instrument
  - did ableton track driven seq mutes 
  - hooked up zebra filters to macros, but how to send to the macros?
  - got macros going to the delays, and s4m-functions writing to the macros
    - need to review the live remote stuff for ramping them
  - somehow I broke my play and stop functions though, wtf!

2022-05-05

  - TODO: make the gate router use a text input for target (copy other device)
  - make it possible to mute input from the seq while preserving midi in

2022-03-22

2022-03-17
  - grid needs formatter attributes for blanking zeros and showing midi notes
  - added attribute for blank zeros
  - added attribute for midi note to pitch (whole grid for now)
  - now numbering for the factors is off course...
  - but it runs much better now

2022-03-16

  - started switch to using int array, will put the formatting in the receiver (grid)

2022-03-14
  - worked on multi views, adding seq labels  
  - track info working fine, chord info has weird bugs

2022-03-14
  - got bar and seq els updating in the cs-view
