Notes on making drum controller

- notes are steps and are hot
- flag for weather velocity is copied or taken from key press
- could use pitch bend for erasing?

Mapping notes:


TODO:
- converting midi note nums to steps
- add listeners for the four knobs and the mod wheel 
  - note that mod wheel and first knob are the same CC, stupid!

ISSUES:
- input only thinks there is one keystep right now
- how do make these flexible for num-ptrks??
- return value from controller methods gets used to determine fall through
  not a great situation

NOTES:
- can change CCs on the keystep to 4 banks of CC
- so we need a way to turn on and off params 


Design:
- pitch, vel, dur all need to be set
- ptrks are enabled for writing or not
- ptrks have values
- if shift-high on, writes to values that get copied by default
- if shift-low on, par touch erases default vals
- pedal down takes precedence

Pedal:
- if the pedal is down, any touched values become hot until the pedal is released


On a hot button:
- current value for pitch, dur, vel, need to be found
- knob default should be vel, fc, del, fdbk

- TODO sequencers should be able to have a default pitch
  - if filled, if no pitch value, that is what gets played

TO ADD:
- when in drum mode, display params-hot and params-set in the gui
- how to toggle writing velocity?
- a note when shift-high on can set pitch
  - Later: how to unset it? for leaving pitch alone in other seqs??
- mode in which notes on key step 2 should override pitch

OUTSTANDING:
- how to set dur??
- a switch to determine whether keyb-2 writes to last-note or
  actually writes to the step - light on top of keyb-2?
- update the manual

BUGS:
- view model craps out if chord track has more than 5 entries
- issue with CV outs

STATUS
- drum machine working
- todo write manual for how drum mixing is working

NEXT:
- test seqs and samples setup
- Next: add using keyb-2 for step mode, last mode

TO add to issue lists - we need to be able to recreate the external I guess?
- to totally recreate the s7 interpreter once GC hits trashing

LEFT OFF:
-
