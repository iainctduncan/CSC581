In Progress & Up Next
======================
Status updates for work underway.

Priority
- making live sets with the live editable sequencers, with gui and track saving
- playing them with csound and modular
- ability to improvise on more than one track - arp, chords, step, drum
- able to start new tune with one touch

Up Next
-------
- full control of modular
- making new track template system
- quantized triggering of sequencers from repl
- global snapshot?

Misc Fixes
----------
- add option so setting a chord automatically adds a gate
- add mode to the meta view
- swap pitch and dur rows
- make buttons 1-8 for arps
- hook up stop and play buttons on the fire
- a save session function that saves all seqs??
- need the data dir to persist on a reset!
- need a way to disable controller input to just play the keystep
- need to improve symbol formatting functions

Modular
-------
- getting modulation data out from other ptracks

Mix Template
------------

Live Set
--------

Drum Sequencers
---------------

File Workflow
-------------
- issue, we lose the save dir on a reset right now, 
- should prob switch to a reboot with init function 
- created new.py, script for making a new tune
- TODO add opening the ableton project to the new-tune script
- TODO add making a vim file and opening it to the new-tune script

Seq Mute Automation from Live
-----------------------------
- new track uses piano roll with a Velocity note for each C 
  - this will get sent to the correct seq track to mute or enable
- M4L device that received the midi

Arrangements
------------
copy and paste for bars?

Filter & Delay controls
-----------------------
- remoting UI now created for Tracks 1-8, vol, plus XY1-4 of
  device 3 (zebrafy delays) - assumes it sends 0 to 1
- turned out too many remotes is a big CPU drain, need to make it optional

Controllers
-----------
- drum mode
- made perform mode, so far it only handles track mutes
  - it should also do loop-lengths

Grid
----

Live API
--------


ViewModel
---------
- chord factor view needs adjusting
- usable as is for now though
- how to get note names for cs-views in pitch column???
  - it's not using the formatters args

GUI
---
- a visual on the meta of which seqs are muted would be good
