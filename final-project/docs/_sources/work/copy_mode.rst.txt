Copy Mode notes
---------------

operations

- pick track - meta
- pick start
- pick end/length
- dest track
- dest start
- pick active ptracks
- reps 
- rep interval

length needs to be able to take steps and bars

Decisions
---------
- paste is keystep, because it's fast - relieves need for reps mostly
- paste mode is keystep 2, play button
- reuse the grid split/high/low thing 

Issues to think about:
----------------------
- wrap around or not?
- time expansion
  - does dur expand
- ability to copy empty space or only events
- keystep probably fastest for selecting active ptrks
- can use shift keys for a from-to on keystep

Implementation notes
- vector for contained ptrks

Manual
------
- pad grid picks source track and start point
- key-2.record picks ptracks active (high low for off on)
- grid picks source-track and source-bar 
- key-1.stop is used to copy individual steps, top C is whole bar
- key-1.play is paste the whole copied pattern to a bar offset
- key-1.rec is paste to steps in a bar (uses meta :bar)
- meta.step can be step offset for entire operation

- left buttons can select groups of tracks
   

Use case
- pick source track/top on grid
  - for a step offset, use bottom buttons
- key1.stop - select length to copy by selecting all steps or specific steps or range
- key1.play - hitting a key puts it into a bar
- later: key2.play - copies only selected steps

Implemented
-----------
- fire meta picking grid mode
- pad grid picking source track and bar

- key-1

LEFT OFF:
- about to implement the actual copy operation
