Step mode working notes

Questions:
- how to erase a step?

- ? could say that keystep two just turns on and off gates and can be used to erase steps 

- step comes from the meta selection (fire)


IMPLEMENTED
- note-ons write note and vel
- writing from last selected dur
- touching knobs and mod are writing params
key-2
  - erase step, bar, seq from keyb2 working
  - in dur submode, key-2 bebop notes set dur
  - in dur submode, key-2 shift bebop notes set dur ticks
  - in gate submode, key-2 notes toggle gates. shift-down turns off or upper octaves
  - key-2-mod sets dur in ticks
key-1
  - play buttons turns on step-follow mode, advances by current dur in steps
    - when already in it, does an extra advance
  - key-1 S-L plus modw 0 which means take vel from keyb
  - key-1 S-H plus modw means update last vel without writing to current step
Grid:
  - works similar to arp
  - left buttons select ptrk
  - grid enters values from 1 to 8 
  - bottom buttons TBD
  - right buttons TBD

TODO
- writing in entire chords
- allow writing factors for arp sequencers (keyb1 submode?)

Hot:
- keystep cc's write to params
- keystep mod writes to vel
- knobs and faders write instantly to the current step
