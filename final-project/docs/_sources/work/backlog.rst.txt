Work to get to later, not actively in progress.

- fix midi output so it's not over sends with latency

- MED: figure out how to do mixins for building many sequencers 

- real time play in live sequencer (for basslines, etc)

- live note api thing for programming drums

- recording output from the sequencers in scheme as timestamped messages

- try out rigging up a listener to run the GC on stop in live
  - also try the offbeat gc thing so it doesn't run on a downbeat


- scheme arranging of Live automation? (ie for fade ins and stuff??)
  - should be possible by just hooking up something to Live macros??
  - maybe csound envelopes to live macros

- get stop button triggering resets

- file organization and backups

- fix arp-seq so I can refer to ptrks by keyword instead of number

- fix arp-seq so one can update-chord-seqs in one call
  (arp-1 'update-chord-seq 0   '(60 65 67 72) 16  '(58 63 67 70))

- hotkey stroke for cueing

- macro tracker interface

- make a hot key to reload the current file
