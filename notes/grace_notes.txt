Grace Notes

- by multiplying two complex numbers adds their angles

- if we multiplty two complex numbers:
  - the answer is a new complex number, new point on the plane
  - the angle from the origin is added, and the magnitude of each is multiplied

- when we plot a sine wave, we are plotting the real component of a
  series number of complex numbers

- when we multiply one complex by another, we rotate on the circle

- 2Pi / w = 2Pi / freq gives us how far we rotate in 

Question A2Q8

- to convert from seconds to radians
  radians -> seconds: 60 / 2pi
  seconds -> radians: 2pi / 60
  
- so what complex number do we need multiple a second postion to move by second
  - equivalent a 6 degree rotation
  - clockwise and counter clockwise

- the complex number {0 + i} rotates one quarter counterclockwise
  - so to rotate 15 minutes, we would multiple by {0 + i} == i
  - to rotate 30 minutes, we would multiply by {0 + i*i} == {0 + -1}
  - to rotate 45 minues, multiple by {0 + i*i*i}

- when an fft is done, each bin's coming out of fft is represented by a complex number,
  where
