TODO:
- fill a sine table
- do wave table oscillation
- make an env
- trigger a note

Notes:
- how to start a note
- the synth function gets called once per block, it needs a table of input data for note ons
  - we could have it do time, dur, freq, amp so four numbers for now
  - so it needs to get an array of 4 arrays

- so we need a way to play note from main thread, sends message to audio thread
  - audio thread gets message, fills buffer that C code handles

- so the next question is how to get the buffer from the C code.
