emscripten instructions
https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
- I installed emsdk in code/emsdk

- to activate it for a shell session
  cd ~/Documents/code/emsdk
  source "/Users/iainduncan/Documents/code/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh"
  source ./emsdk_env.sh

(using code in my documents/code/wasm/hello folder)

- compile some c to a js file that can be included:
  $ emcc hello.c -o hello.js

- now the hello.js can be added in a script tag, and any printf will become console output.

- we can also have the compiler only create the wasm file without making the js plumbing,
  in which case we would make the js to download and instantiate the module
- this is called "buidling a side module". we need to add optimization level and explict exports:
  emcc adder.c -s SIDE_MODULE=2 -O1 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS=['_add'] -o adder.wasm
- this gives us the wasm file and we need to manually make the boilerplate to load it

- we will get it and compile it using the browers webassembly API
- we need to get the module using "fetch", which returns a promise
- and then we compile it, using WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming
  - this returns a Promise that, when fulfilled, holds a 'module' property and an 'instance' property
   holding a WebAssembly.Module and WebAssembly.Instance respectively

- this has examples of how we can use this in the web audio worklet:

- left off not sure how to share memory because in my manually instantiated code
  I don't have a Module reference

- I think the solution is in the hard part of chapter 4 in the book
  - issue is I'm not using generated js (-o js) so I have no Module object

- compiling with multiply is working, perhaps try to get at its memory?

- I need to try the first approach listed in this article:
https://developer.chrome.com/blog/audio-worklet-design-pattern/

- best tutorial is here! https://marcoselvatici.github.io/WASM_tutorial/#memory

Questions
- how can I get at cwrap and ccall?
- left off trying to figure out how the fuck to pass memory back and forth
